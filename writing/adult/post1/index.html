    <p>It's been a long day of hunting and gathering for medical supplies, Lucien groans as he cracks his back. "I suppose I should start heading home..." He makes sure that all of his findings are with him before hearing a shout.</p>
    <p>"You're gonna be my new plaything! Have a taste, on the house!"</p>
    <p>Lucien turns around just in time to see a grenade fly past his head. He rolls out of the way and slides behind a tree. He sighs and mutters under his breath: "Damn Blood Eagles... They haunt me now, even after I left."</p>
    <p>"Don't hide, you're making me sad... I promise I won't hurt you!"</p>
    <p>Lucien sighs and pulls his syringer off his back and a syringe of Calmex from his belt. He pulls a syringer round out, filling it with the Calmex. Lucien then hears footsteps getting closer; he only has one chance at this.</p>
    <p>"Why are you hiding? I thought we were friends."</p>
    <p>Lucien points the syringer around the base of the tree and fires blindly. The syringe finds its mark, nailing the Blood Eagle directly in her neck.</p>
    <p>"Hah, you're going to need more than... That..." The Blood Eagle staggers for a moment, feeling woozy and nauseous "<i>cough</i> I... I don't feel so good."</p>
    <p>Lucien stands up and dusts himself off, "That was three doses of Calmex, usually that would cause an overdose." he walks over to the Blood Eagle, who is now prone, caressing her cheek. "But I feel like you'll be just fine..."</p>
    <p>"I.. I am your god, now..." The Blood Eagle mutters out before falling unconscious.</p>
    <p>"Well, I suppose I should take her with me," Lucien mumbles, throwing the unconscious Blood Eagle over his shoulder, grunting a bit, adjusting to the weight.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>After a while, the Blood Eagle wakes up. She blinks a few times, trying to make her eyes adjust to the darkness, until she realizes there is a dim red light.</p>
    <p>"You're finally awake,"</p>
    <p>She immediately tries to move, but is unable to; her arms and legs are strapped down. She squirms more, but she already knows it's useless, "You're fucking dead when I get out of here, I'm going to gut you like yesterday's dinner."</p>
    <p>"Funny you should mention that, because that's exactly what will happen to you if you keep being naughty." Lucien pulls an Addictol from his belt and forces the mouthpiece into her mouth. "Be a good girl and take a deep breath."</p>
    <p>She fights to spit it out and manages to knock it to the floor, "Blood Eagles fear nothing and no one; *I* am not afraid of death."</p>
    <p>"Tsk Tsk Tsk, I was only trying to help... Now to do this the hard way." Lucien backhands the Blood Eagle, leaving a small bead of blood trailing down her face.</p>
    <p>"You're really starting to piss me off... I'm going to bathe in your blood when this is over."</p>
    <p>Lucien just rolls his eyes behind his mask, grabbing a syringe off a nearby table and stabbing it directly into her thigh. </p>
    <p>"I just dosed you with Med-X, Buffout, and Mentats." He lets out muffled, shrill laughter. "That way you can live through the hell you've brought on yourself and be hyper aware that you royally fucked up."</p>
    <p>The Blood Eagle struggles against her restraints again, desperately fighting to get out, but again... nothing.</p>
    <p>"This next part is going to be lots of fun... For me..." Lucien grabs a sickle and tucks the tip into her blouse and rakes it down her front, cutting her clothes away with one swipe, exposing her nude form to the cold air.</p>
    <p>She opens her mouth to speak but feels she's... afraid and unable to form the words. She keeps trying to struggle as her nipples harden from the cold air.</p>
    <p>"You keep making this much harder for yourself by struggling..." He brings the knife up to her chest and carefully drags the jagged edge across her skin, slicing into her.</p>
    <p>She groans as she feels the jagged stone blade rake across her flesh. She begins struggling harder and harder as tears start to form in the corners of her eyes. She knows her end is near, but the drug slurry is keeping her awake and aware.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>"Let's see what's all in here..." Lucien says, reaching into the cavity and beginning to feel around.</p>
    <p>"You... You piece of shit..." She mutters, sputtering blood as she chokes out the words.</p>
    <p>"You caused this. You could have had it easier," Lucien reaches further into her chest, grazing her lungs with his knuckles, bruising the soft, delicate skin. </p>
    <p>"*Gasp* It hurts to breathe, everything's going black..."</p>
    <p>He grabs her heart and gives it a tug, tearing it free from her chest. "Hush Now... It'll all be over soon."</p>
