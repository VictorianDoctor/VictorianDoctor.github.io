    <p>Your fellow Brothers and Sisters were ordered to build a ship-killer platform because of a nearby corpus outpost. Their ships may have been bigger and more advanced, but any ship can be taken down with enough artillery. </p>
    <p>Today, however, you drew the short stick: You get put on crew ship duty. It's much less work, but that's the issue: It's boring. As you sit below deck, taking inventory, you hear a shout from one of your Brothers... It's the Tenno.</p>
    <p>You grab your Grakata and run to help your Brothers. The Tenno was powerful, but they couldn't take you all, Right?</p>
    <p>But as you reach the top of the stairs, you finally hear it: The Alarms, They destroyed the reactor. Looking around, you also see the bodies of your Brother's and Sister's around you: They didn't stand a chance.</p>
    <p>You had one chance. But in the end, you know it wouldn't have made a difference. Plus, you finally realize something. It all meant nothing, your entire life: Everything you've done. You will just get replaced by clones and crossed off a list. You shed a tear then and mutter your final words: "For the Queens." The words mean nothing anymore, but it's all you've ever known. You then sigh your final breath.</p>
