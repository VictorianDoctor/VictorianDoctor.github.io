            <h1>NEW KILLER – THE SCOURGE</h1>
            <p>A notorious doctor with a reputable name. But as decades passed, his methods got crueler, Leaving countless lives lost to his hands. His now tarnished reputation leaves fear in the hearts around him.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://imgur.com/a/b39Clkz" class="link">POWER</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Malpractice</strong></p>
            <p>The Scourge doesn't have an active ability, he instead affects Survivors overtime with slower action speed while gaining speed and terror radius.</p>
            <p><strong>Special Status Effect –  Psychosis:</strong> Psychosis punishes Survivors who spend too much time alone. Survivors afflicted with Psychosis perform Conspicuous Actions more slowly overall. To recover from Psychosis, the affected Survivor must stay close to other Survivors.</p>
            <h2>THE SCOURGE’S PERKS</h2>
            <p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/a/wJHDtB6" class="link">Scourge Hook: Purgation:</a></strong> Upon hooking a Survivor on a scourge hook the Survivor recovers from negative status effects, but they get applied to the other Survivors.</p>
            <p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/a/jcYRaqk" class="link">Damnation:</a></strong> When a Survivor takes a protection hit by any means, they become Exhausted and become afflicted with Deep Wound.</p>
            <p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/a/96SlIKC" class="link">Falter The Faithless:</a></strong> Whenever a Survivor vaults during a chase, that Survivor will then begin to perform vaults more slowly.</p>
            <hr/>
            <h2>NEW SURVIVOR – Athyes Woods</h2>
<p>Although his soul was tainted with his heinous actions and sinful deeds, He has never truly lost his mind. Or, that's what he likes to believe, since he is a doctor, after all...</p>
<h3>Athyes Woods’s Perks</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/a/2iafSuT" class="link">Spiritual Healer</a></strong> After completing a healing action on another survivor, you cure them of all status effects and apply them to yourself. You recover from these status effects faster than usual.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/a/QGs903o" class="link">Bittersweet Betrayal:</a></strong> Whenever a different survivor loses a health state, you and the killer see each other's aura for a short duration.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/a/pHB5rVw" class="link">Boon: Noxious Smite:</a></strong> You set up a boon that by itself has no effect. however, when the killer snuffs it they get afflicted with the Hindered and Blindness Status Effects, while also getting stunned.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>NEW MAP – THE FORGOTTEN SPIRE</h2>
<p>The town of Burnsely was once a thriving community with a reputable doctor and is now known as a town with a tainted past of deceit and a god complex. The Fragmented Minds Chapter introduces this new Map – <strong>The Forgotten Spire</strong> – from the Realm – <strong>The Decimated Borgo</strong>.</p>
