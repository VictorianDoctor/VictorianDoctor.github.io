            <p>It has been exactly one year since I first opened the rift to this hellish plane, I have yet to come up with a name for it. However, There seems to be a lot more that needs to be explored. The main landmass alone could be explored for weeks on end by a large group and still have unmapped ground, I fear I have gone too far and have reached a point of no return.</p>
